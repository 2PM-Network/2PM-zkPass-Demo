The SDK facilitates the integration of zkPass into web applications, allowing users to selectively and privately validate their data.

## Features

Our project utilizes zkPass to acquire and verify customer cryptocurrency asset data from the Binance platform. This data serves as input for financial models, analyzing users' trading behaviors and roles.
